# CAE Agent Hub

**Language:** English | [中文](README.zh-CN.md)

CAE Agent Hub is a collection of MCP servers, reusable agent skills, solver automation scripts, and browser result viewers for mainstream engineering simulation software. The goal is to let AI coding clients such as Codex, Cursor, Claude Code, or Claude Desktop work with real CAE tools instead of only generating offline examples.

The current repository includes:

- MCP servers for Abaqus/CAE, ANSYS Fluent, ANSYS Workbench Mechanical, and Ansys Electronics Desktop / HFSS.
- Abaqus-focused finite element skills organized by workflow stage.
- The original Text to CAE browser viewer for inspecting exported `result_mesh.json` simulation results.
- Example workflows and templates that keep solver binaries, licenses, private paths, and generated results out of source control.

## Repository

```text
https://github.com/Cai-aa/CAE-Agent-Hub
```

The old `text-to-cae` name is kept in some folder names for compatibility with existing viewer cases.

## Architecture

```text
AI client
  -> MCP server or skill instruction
  -> live CAE application or solver script
  -> native solver results
  -> exported lightweight viewer data
  -> browser inspection or report workflow
```

This repository separates responsibilities:

- **MCP servers** provide live tool access to installed CAE applications.
- **Skills** provide reusable modeling, setup, solving, postprocessing, and validation instructions.
- **CAE applications** perform the real solve.
- **Viewer modules** inspect exported result data without requiring the solver to be open.

## Installation

### Clone

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Cai-aa/CAE-Agent-Hub.git
Set-Location .\CAE-Agent-Hub
```

If you cloned the repository before the rename, the old `text-to-cae` remote may still work through GitHub redirects. Updating the remote URL is clearer:

```powershell
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Cai-aa/CAE-Agent-Hub.git
```

### Use an MCP server

Each MCP folder has its own README and environment template. The common local pattern is:

```powershell
Set-Location ".\MCP\<vendor>\<server folder>"
py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -U pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -e .
```

Then register the server with your MCP-capable client using the example config in that folder.

### Use skills

Skills are instruction modules, not solver binaries. Copy the complete skill directory into your agent's skill directory or attach the relevant `SKILL.md` as project context.

Codex example:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills" | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force ".\Skill\abaqus\analysis\abaqus-static-analysis" "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills\abaqus-static-analysis"
```

Suggested prompt:

```text
Use the abaqus-static-analysis, abaqus-mesh, abaqus-job, and abaqus-odb skills. Build a complete Abaqus static-analysis workflow, run it if the Abaqus MCP or local Abaqus CLI is available, and report the exact files and commands used.
```

## Text to CAE Viewer

The viewer is still included as the browser result-inspection layer. It can display cases that contain `result_mesh.json` even when the solver is not installed.

```powershell
Set-Location .\viewer
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the Vite URL, usually:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/
```

Example cases:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=cantilever
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=hole-plate
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=hole-plate-modal
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=sphere-impact
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=milling-3d
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=gear-mesh
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=bullet-plate
```

## Source Control Policy

The repository should include reusable source, documentation, tests, examples, templates, and skill instructions.

It should not include:

- CAE software binaries or licenses.
- Private machine paths or credentials.
- Virtual environments and package caches.
- Generated solver outputs such as ODB, case/data, AEDT results, Workbench projects, logs, and screenshots.
- Large local result artifacts that can be regenerated.

## Build

Build the frontend viewer:

```powershell
Set-Location .\viewer
npm.cmd run build
```

## Roadmap

The hub is designed to grow toward more mainstream simulation ecosystems:

- More solver-specific MCP servers.
- More productized skill packs for repeatable modeling and validation workflows.
- Shared result export formats for viewer and report generation.
- Safer install prompts and verification scripts for each CAE application.
