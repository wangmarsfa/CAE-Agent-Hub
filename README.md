# Text to CAE

Text to CAE is a local Abaqus simulation workspace with a browser-based result viewer. It is designed for workflows where an AI coding client, such as Codex, Cursor, or Claude Desktop, writes and edits Abaqus Python scripts, runs Abaqus/CAE, exports solver results, and displays those results in an interactive web UI.

The project connects three layers:

- **Abaqus/CAE** builds models, runs jobs, and writes ODB result databases.
- **Abaqus MCP** lets an AI client inspect and control a live Abaqus/CAE session.
- **Text to CAE Viewer** loads exported `result_mesh.json`, project metadata, parameters, time frames, contours, and model trees in the browser.

Repository:

```text
https://github.com/Cai-aa/text-to-cae
```

Companion Abaqus MCP repository:

```text
https://github.com/Cai-aa/abaqus-mcp
```

## Recommended Workflow

```text
Codex or another MCP-capable AI client
  -> connects to Abaqus/CAE through Abaqus MCP
  -> creates or edits Abaqus Python scripts
  -> asks Abaqus to build, mesh, solve, and read ODB data
  -> exports result_mesh.json
  -> opens the Text to CAE browser viewer
```

This keeps the responsibilities clear:

- The AI client handles natural-language changes, code editing, debugging, and automation.
- Abaqus/CAE handles the real solver work.
- The browser viewer handles fast interactive inspection of CAE results.

## Requirements

- Windows
- Node.js and npm
- Abaqus/CAE for solver-backed runs
- Python available to Abaqus scripts
- Optional: an MCP-capable AI client plus [Abaqus MCP](https://github.com/Cai-aa/abaqus-mcp)

The viewer can display any case that already has a `result_mesh.json`. Abaqus is only required when you want to regenerate solver output or run a case from the browser.

## Install and Run the Viewer

Clone the project:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Cai-aa/text-to-cae.git
Set-Location .\text-to-cae
```

Install viewer dependencies:

```powershell
Set-Location .\viewer
npm.cmd install
```

Start the local viewer:

```powershell
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/
```

If port `4178` is already in use, choose another port:

```powershell
$env:VIEWER_PORT = "4181"
npm.cmd run dev
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4181/
```

## Open Example Cases

Use the `case` query parameter to open a specific simulation:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=cantilever
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=hole-plate
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=hole-plate-modal
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=sphere-impact
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=milling-3d
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=gear-mesh
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=bullet-plate
```

The viewer includes an Abaqus-style result viewport:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/?case=sphere-impact&mode=cae
```

## Browser-to-Abaqus Runs

The Vite dev server includes local CAE API endpoints:

```text
/__cae/project
/__cae/result-mesh
/__cae/result-summary
/__cae/parameters
/__cae/run
```

For runnable examples, the browser can update parameters and trigger Abaqus noGUI execution:

```text
viewer
  -> /__cae/run
  -> Abaqus noGUI
  -> *_abaqus.py
  -> export_*.py
  -> result_mesh.json
  -> viewer refresh
```

By default the viewer looks for Abaqus at:

```text
G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat
```

If Abaqus is installed elsewhere, set `ABAQUS_COMMAND` before starting the viewer:

```powershell
$env:ABAQUS_COMMAND = "C:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat"
npm.cmd run dev
```

## Case File Layout

Each example case normally contains:

```text
models/<case>/
  cae_parameters.json
  cae_project.json
  *_abaqus.py
  export_*.py
  result_mesh.json
```

File roles:

- `*_abaqus.py` builds the Abaqus model, assigns materials, meshes, defines steps, applies loads and boundary conditions, and submits the job.
- `export_*.py` reads ODB output and exports browser-readable mesh, contour, displacement, modal, or dynamic-frame data.
- `result_mesh.json` is the main result payload loaded by the viewer.
- `cae_project.json` stores project metadata, workflow state, model tree data, output paths, and result metrics.
- `cae_parameters.json` stores editable input parameters used by the browser run panel.

## Included Examples

| Case | Directory | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cantilever beam | `models/text-to-cae` | Static introductory case with displacement and stress contours. |
| Plate with hole | `models/text-to-cae-hole-plate` | Tensile plate with circular-hole stress concentration. |
| Plate with hole modal | `models/text-to-cae-hole-plate-modal` | Frequency extraction case with modal frames. |
| Sphere impact | `models/text-to-cae-sphere-impact` | Explicit dynamics example showing sphere-to-plate contact, impact, indentation, and rebound. |
| 3D milling | `models/text-to-cae-milling-3d` | End-milling dynamics visualization with editable machining parameters. |
| Gear mesh | `models/text-to-cae-gear-mesh` | Spur gear meshing dynamics with driver and driven gear parameters. |
| Bullet plate | `models/text-to-cae-bullet-plate` | High-speed projectile penetration example. |

Some large result files are intentionally not committed. Regenerate them locally with Abaqus or with the provided refresh scripts.

## Refresh Visual Result Data

Some examples include deterministic refresh scripts that can rebuild browser preview data without waiting for a full solver run:

```powershell
node models\text-to-cae-sphere-impact\refresh_contact_result.mjs
node models\text-to-cae-milling-3d\refresh_visual_result.mjs
node models\text-to-cae-gear-mesh\refresh_gear_result.mjs
```

## Run Abaqus Scripts Directly

You can also run cases from the command line without using the browser run button.

Sphere impact:

```powershell
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-sphere-impact\sphere_impact_abaqus.py
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-sphere-impact\export_dynamic_mesh.py
```

3D milling:

```powershell
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-milling-3d\milling_abaqus.py
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-milling-3d\export_milling_mesh.py
```

Gear mesh:

```powershell
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-gear-mesh\gear_mesh_abaqus.py
& "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat" cae noGUI=models\text-to-cae-gear-mesh\export_gear_mesh.py
```

## Connect Codex to Abaqus with MCP

Install Abaqus MCP:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Cai-aa/abaqus-mcp.git $env:USERPROFILE\.abaqus-mcp
pip install mcp
```

Let Abaqus/CAE load the MCP startup environment:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.abaqus-mcp\abaqus_v6.env.example" "$env:USERPROFILE\abaqus_v6.env"
```

Optional GUI menu plugin:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.abaqus-mcp\abaqus_plugins\mcp_control" "$env:USERPROFILE\abaqus_plugins\mcp_control"
```

After restarting Abaqus/CAE, start MCP from:

```text
Plug-ins -> MCP -> Start MCP
```

You can also start it from the Abaqus Python console:

```python
mcp_start()
```

If background threads are unstable in your Abaqus version, use the cooperative or blocking loop:

```python
mcp_coop_loop()
```

or:

```python
mcp_loop()
```

Configure your MCP-capable client with the Abaqus MCP server. A typical shape is:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "abaqus-mcp": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["C:/Users/<your-user>/.abaqus-mcp/mcp_server.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<your-user>` with your Windows user name, or use an absolute Python interpreter path if `python` is not on `PATH`.

## Viewer Controls

The UI is organized around:

- A left model tree for project, parts, materials, assembly, steps, loads, boundary conditions, mesh, jobs, and results.
- A central 3D viewport for contours, mesh edges, dynamic frames, modal shapes, tools, spheres, gears, projectiles, and other case objects.
- A right panel for state, metrics, editable parameters, and run controls.

Common interactions:

- Left drag: rotate the model.
- Middle drag: pan the model.
- Mouse wheel: zoom.
- Play controls: animate dynamic or modal frames.
- Theme controls: switch between Abaqus, dark, and light viewport styles.

## Git and Large Files

The repository excludes generated or large local artifacts, including:

- `viewer/node_modules/`
- `viewer/dist/`
- `viewer/dist-verify/`
- Abaqus `.odb`
- Abaqus `.inp`
- Abaqus intermediate files such as `.sim`, `.dat`, `.msg`, `.sta`, `.prt`, and `.lck`
- Python `__pycache__`
- very large generated `result_mesh.json` files

These files can be recreated by installing dependencies, rebuilding the viewer, rerunning Abaqus scripts, or using the refresh scripts.

## Build

Build the frontend:

```powershell
Set-Location .\viewer
npm.cmd run build
```

The build output is written to `viewer/dist/`.

## Troubleshooting

### The page does not open

Make sure the dev server is running:

```powershell
Set-Location .\viewer
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite, normally:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4178/
```

### The viewer does not show updated results

Click the refresh control in the viewer or reload the browser page. `result_mesh.json` is loaded at runtime, so the page may still be showing the previous result payload.

### Abaqus does not start from the browser

Check `ABAQUS_COMMAND`:

```powershell
$env:ABAQUS_COMMAND
```

If it is empty or points to the wrong path, set it before starting the viewer:

```powershell
$env:ABAQUS_COMMAND = "G:\SIMULIA\Commands\abaqus.bat"
npm.cmd run dev
```

### Some result files are missing after clone

Large ODB, INP, and generated result files are not committed. Regenerate them with the corresponding Abaqus script or refresh script.
